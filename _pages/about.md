I am an energy engineer, holding a PhD in mechanical engineering. My [research](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/638748) _(link to PhD dissertation)_ focused on optimal integration of thermal energy storage in district heating and cooling systems. The research aim was to maximize utilization of renewable energy sources in the built environment and reduce the use of fossil fuels as much as possible. In order to get there, I model components in thermal networks and combine everything into an optimization problem, with an emphasis on system integration.

Before starting my PhD, I obtained a bachelor in mechanical and electronic engineering at KU Leuven and a dual master degree in Energy for Smart Cities (MSc in Energy Engineering) from both KU Leuven and KTH in Stockholm. At KTH, I graduated with a study on big data analysis for the heat demand of the Stockholm district heating system. This thesis was awarded the Vattenfall Energy Award in 2014.

Currently I am working at the Flemish Energy Regulator VREG as the technical supervisor of district heating and cooling networks in Flanders.

In my free time, I enjoy playing and listening to music: I play the cello. Occasionally, I like to draw as well. Furthermore, I am passionate about KU Leuven's [Thermotechnical Institute](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/tme/thermotechnisch-instituut), one of Belgium's most extensive collections of historical engines.
