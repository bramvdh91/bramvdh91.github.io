*I am an energy engineer, looking for and implementing solutions to drive the sustainable energy transition forward. My main interest is how to decarbonize heating and cooling in the built environment.*

Currently, I am working as R&D Expert on Modelling and Control of Thermal Systems at [EnergyVille](https://energyville.be/en/)-[VITO](https://vito.be/en). **EnergyVille** is a collaboration between the Belgian research partners KU Leuven, VITO, imec and UHasselt in the fields of sustainable energy and intelligent energy systems. 

I hold a PhD in mechanical engineering from KU Leuven, supervised by prof. dr. ir. **Lieve Helsen** of the [Thermal Systems Simulation Group](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/tme/research/thermal_systems). My [PhD research](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/638748) _(link to PhD dissertation)_ focused on optimal integration of thermal energy storage in district heating and cooling systems. The research aim was to maximize utilization of renewable energy sources in the built environment and reduce the use of fossil fuels as much as possible. In order to get there, I model components in thermal networks and combine everything into an optimization problem, with an emphasis on system integration.

Before starting my PhD, I obtained a bachelor in mechanical and electronic engineering at KU Leuven and a dual master degree in **Energy for Smart Cities** (MSc in Energy Engineering) from both KU Leuven and KTH in Stockholm. At KTH, I graduated with a study on big data analysis for the heat demand of the Stockholm district heating system. This thesis was awarded the Vattenfall Energy Award in 2014.

Apart from my academic experience, I have also gained experience with **energy market regulation** at the Flemish energy market regulator, VREG. There, I mainly contributed to the development of district heating regulation in the Flemish Region, as well as tracking renewable energy through Guarantees of Origin. I further contributed to the Guarantee of Origin system at the [Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB)](http://aib-net.org/), where I worked as EECS Quality Officer in the AIB Secreteriat.

In my free time, I enjoy playing and listening to music: I play the cello. Occasionally, I like to draw as well. Furthermore, I am passionate about KU Leuven's [Thermotechnical Institute](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/tme/thermotechnisch-instituut), one of Belgium's most extensive collections of historical engines. Finally, I am a classic car enthusiast and drive and maintain a 1983 CitroÃ«n Dyane.
