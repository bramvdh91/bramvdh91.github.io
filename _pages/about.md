I am an engineer and currently pursuing a PhD in mechanical engineering. My research focuses on optimal integration of thermal energy storage in district heating and cooling systems. The research aim is to maximize utilization of renewable energy sources in those systems and reduce the use of fossil fuels as much as possible. In order to get there, I model the system components and combine everything into an optimization problem, focussing on system integration.
#TODO Too many systems

Before starting my PhD, I obtained a bachelor in mechanical and electronic engineering at KU Leuven and a dual master degree in Energy for Smart Cities (MSc in Energy Engineering) from both KU Leuven and KTH in Stockholm. At KTH, I graduated with a study on big data analysis for the heat demand of the Stockholm district heating system. This thesis was awarded the Vattenfall Energy Award in 2014.

In my free time, I enjoy playing and listening to music. I play the cello in the University Symphony Orchestra in Leuven. Furthermore, I am passionate about KU Leuven's [Thermotechnical Institute](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/tme/thermotechnisch-instituut), one of Belgium's most extensive collections of historical engines.
