Guiding practical sessions within a second year course in the Bachelor in Engineering Science, option Mechanical Engineering. The students get practical experience with systems they have studied before in theoretical lectures. One lab focuses on getting acquainted with affinity laws, applying this theory on an experimental set-up with centrifugal pumps. Another lab focuses on understanding psychrometrics using an airconditioning installation.
As an assistant, I have also contributed to an update of the lab sessions in the Thermotechnical Institute. This used to be a guided tour around the museum collection, trying to link theory of turbomachinery and applied thermodynamics on historical engines and turbines. We transformed the lab session into a more interactive session with actual demos of historical steam, diesel and jet engines, as such reinforcing the connection between theory and practice.
