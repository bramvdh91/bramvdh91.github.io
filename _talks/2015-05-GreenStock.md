This presentation proposes an indicator for the state of charge (SoC) of thermally activated building systems (TABS), more specifically for the case of concrete core activation (CCA) of a floor. Furthermore, an experimental method for the SoC determination with an optimal (minimal) set of real-time measurements is elaborated. The methodology is based on the identification of a grey box model of the floor which allows calculating the SoC. In this paper, the methodology is applied to a 3D simulation of a massive concrete floor with CCA.
