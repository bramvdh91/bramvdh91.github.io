In future Smart Energy Systems, many energy carriers will be interlinked to enable 100% renewable energy supply. For future thermal networks (district heating and cooling), this means temperatures and mass flow rates will be returning, and advanced control algorithms will be needed. In order to optimally design and control these networks, a new generation of simulation tools will be needed. This presentation shows such a new model and applies it to a case study, where the need for accurate models becomes clear.
